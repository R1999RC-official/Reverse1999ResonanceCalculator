This is a fork of the popular tool [demjson](https://github.com/dmeranda/demjson) to only support Python 3.
The decision to do this is mainly based on all the headache caused
by trying to support Python 2 AND 3.

<b>demjson3</b> is a [Python language](http://python.org/) module for
encoding, decoding, and syntax-checking [JSON](http://json.org/)
data.  It works under Python 3.

It comes with a <b>jsonlint</b> script which can be used to validate
your JSON documents for strict conformance to the JSON specification,
and to detect potential data portability issues.  It can also reformat
or pretty-print JSON documents; either by re-indenting or removing
unnecessary whitespace.


What's new
==========

<b>Version 3.0.0</b> will start to only work under Python 3.

<b>Version 2.2.4</b> fixes problem with jsonlint under Python 3 when
trying to reformat JSON (-f or -F options) and writing the output to
standard output.

<b>Version 2.2.3</b> fixes incorrect return values from the "jsonlint"
command.  Also fixes a minor problem with the included unit tests in
certain Python versions.

<b>Version 2.2.2</b> fixes installation problems with certain Python 3
versions prior to Python 3.4.  No other changes.

<b>Version 2.2.1</b> adds an enhancement for HTML safety, and a few
obscure bug fixes.

<b>Version 2.2</b> fixes compatibility with Python 2.6 and
narrow-Unicode Pythons, fixes bugs with statistics, and adds many
enhancements to the treatment of numbers and floating-point values.

<b>Version 2.0.1</b> is a re-packaging of 2.0, after discovering
problems with incorrect checksums in the PyPI distribution of 2.0.  No
changes were made from 2.0.

<b>Version 2.0</b>, released 2014-05-21, is a MAJOR new version with many
changes and improvements.

Visit http://nielstron.github.io/demjson3/ for complete details and documentation. Additional documentation may also be found
under the "docs/" folder of the source.

The biggest changes in 2.0 include:

  * Now works in Python 3; minimum version supported is Python 2.6
  * Much improved reporting of errors and warnings
  * Extensible with user-supplied hooks
  * Handles many additional Python data types automatically
  * Statistics

There are many more changes.


Example use
===========

To use demjson3 from within your Python programs:

```python
    >>> import demjson3

    >>> demjson3.encode( ['one',42,True,None] )    # From Python to JSON
    '["one",42,true,null]'

    >>> demjson3.decode( '["one",42,true,null]' )  # From JSON to Python
    ['one', 42, True, None]
```

To check a JSON data file for errors or problems:

```bash
    $ jsonlint my.json

    my.json:1:8: Error: Numbers may not have extra leading zeros: '017'
       |  At line 1, column 8, offset 8
    my.json:4:10: Warning: Object contains same key more than once: 'Name'
       |  At line 4, column 10, offset 49
       |  Object started at line 1, column 0, offset 0 (AT-START)
    my.json:9:11: Warning: Integers larger than 53-bits are not portable
       |  At line 9, column 11, offset 142
    my.json: has errors
```


Why use demjson3?
================

I wrote demjson3 before Python had any JSON support in its standard
library.  If all you need is to be able to read or write JSON data,
then you may wish to just use what's built into Python.

However demjson3 is extremely feature rich and is quite useful in
certain applications.  It is especially good at error checking
JSON data and for being able to parse more of the JavaScript syntax
than is permitted by strict JSON.

A few advantages of demjson3 are:

 * It generally has better error handling and "lint" checking capabilities;

 * It will automatically use the Python Decimal (bigfloat) class
   instead of a floating-point number whenever there might be an
   overflow or loss of precision otherwise.

 * It can correctly deal with different Unicode encodings, including ASCII.
   It will automatically adapt when to use \u-escapes based on the encoding.

 * It generates more conservative JSON, such as escaping Unicode
   format control characters or line terminators, which should improve
   data portability.

 * In non-strict mode it can also deal with slightly non-conforming
   input that is more JavaScript than JSON (such as allowing comments).

 * It supports a broader set of Python types during conversion.


Installation
============

To install, type:

```bash
   python setup.py install
```

or optionally just copy the file "demjson3.py" to whereever you want.
See "docs/INSTALL.txt" for more detailed instructions, including how
to run the self-tests.


More information
================

See the files under the "docs" subdirectory.  The module is also
self-documented, so within the python interpreter type:

```python
    import demjson3
    help(demjson3)
```

or from a shell command line:

```bash
    pydoc demjson3
```

The "jsonlint" command script which gets installed as part of demjson3
has built-in usage instructions as well.  Just type:

```bash
   jsonlint --help
```

Complete documentation and additional information is also available
on the project homepage at http://nielstron.github.io/demjson3/

It is also available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/demjson3/
